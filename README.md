# moodle-tool_dataprivacy
The Data Privacy Plugin Tool for Moodle

_**Notes:**_
1. Moodle versions 3.3.8, 3.4.5 and 3.5 ship with tool_dataprivacy by default. So if you're installing or upgrading to Moodle 3.5, you don't need to install this plugin.
2. If you are using Moodle 3.3.7/3.4.4 or below, and you already have this tool installed, please remember to remove this plugin's code folder before upgrading to the latest Moodle versions.
